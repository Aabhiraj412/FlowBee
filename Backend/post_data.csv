“I founded and still lead the Black in Product Operations community and serve as a facilitator for our new Black employees onboarding program called The Collective,” Augustine says. He is also an active member of numerous other employee resource groups, including Black@ YouTube, the Black Googler Network, and Africans@ Google. “These communities have been incredibly valuable to me, offering a strong sense of belonging and opportunities for leadership development,” he adds.

In his day-to-day role, Augustine helps teams track their progress. “This involves managing performance reporting, developing tools and dashboards to monitor key metrics, and collaborating with teams to ensure successful launches,” Augustine explains.

Augustine's biggest takeaway since joining Google? “The power individuals have to create positive change, both within their roles and in the broader community.”

In the words of Brandon, a current member of the program, “Genesis is designed to equip you with the skills and experiences you need to thrive in the world of finance at Google. It's like a finance bootcamp, but way more fun!” Members of the Genesis program rotate through various areas of corporate finance — working on everything from creating financial models for product teams, to collaborating with stakeholders on process improvements. “The best part though,” Brandon explained, “is that early in your career, you get the chance to gain insights into how a company like Google operates — all while developing crucial leadership and problem-solving skills.”

For Jessica, another Genesis Googler, what happens outside her core role is just as important as the skills learned in it. “What I value most about the Genesis program is the strong sense of community. Starting your career alongside a cohort of peers creates a safe space to navigate the challenges we face as young professionals.”

After a decade of appeals, he received a call from his legal team saying that he was going to be let out of prison. His legal team worked with lawyers from Amazon to build his exoneration case. For the past 10 years, Amazon’s legal and public policy teams of over 2,200 employees have volunteered their expertise and resources to make a difference through our pro bono program, and this is one example of that work.

This is one example of how our legal and public policy teams of over 2,200 employees have volunteered to help make a difference through our pro bono program.

When children flee from war, violence, or persecution in their home countries and arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border, they can face the same deportation process as an adult, often without any legal counsel. Our team has partnered withto represent children and help them remain in the U.S.

This is another example.

This need for pro bono work all around the world is greater than ever, and we will continue to invest our time and resources into the program. We are proud to celebrate 10 years of pro bono work at Amazon this year. Read more about the program here:

Meet Chinemerem (Chí-Chí) Nwandu, an HR Assistant at DOX2, who’s inspiring Amazon journey showcases remarkable career growth and the importance of a supportive company culture.

Chí-Chí relocated from Nigeria in January 2020 for her Master's Degree, and shortly after, the world went into lockdown. She found herself in a foreign country, far from family and friends, leaving her lonely and frustrated. Then, she got a job with Amazon, which changed everything.

Chí-Chí started her career at Amazon as a warehouse associate working with a dedicated team focused on maintaining product quality. Two years later, she continued her career at Amazon as an HR Assistant, where she’s been able to utilise her knowledge of employment law and HR/payroll practices, enhance employee engagement, and even have the opportunity to take on an interim managerial position.

A rewarding part of Chí-Chí’s role is aligning HR initiatives with business goals while promoting fairness across the organization. As an active member of the UK Ops Black Employee Network (BEN) affinity group, she’s deeply passionate about promoting diversity, particularly for young Black female employees, and using her voice to raise awareness about the challenges ethnic minorities face in the workplace.

“I enjoy working at Amazon because of its strong commitment to diversity, inclusion, and fostering a supportive workplace culture. Being part of a company that values people from all backgrounds allows for rich collaboration and the exchange of unique perspectives, which drives innovation and creativity.”"
